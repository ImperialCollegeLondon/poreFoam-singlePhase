# poreFoam/singlePhase

___

Pre- and post-processing codes and a direct Naview-Stokes solver for simulating incompressible single-phase flow on 3D images of porous media using OpenFOAM

---

### Prerequisites 

- OpenFOAM-v1612+
- zlib-1.2.11 (optional)
- voxelImage library (included)


If you are not familiar with openfoam, please consider using the branch [pore+miniFoamLibZTif](https://github.com/aliraeini/poreFoam-singlePhase/tree/pore+miniFoamLibZTif), which includes all the above prerequisites and hence easier to install. Moreover, it has a slightly lower memory (RAM) footprint.

### Instructions 

- Please see the doc folder for [installation and usage](https://github.com/aliraeini/poreFoam-singlePhase/blob/master/doc/UserGuide_poreFoam_singlePhase.md),  and a sample input file -- [Berea.mhd](https://github.com/aliraeini/poreFoam-singlePhase/blob/master/doc/Berea.mhd) -- for the [Berea.raw image](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/perm/research/pore-scale-modelling/micro-ct-images-and-networks/berea-sandstone/)
